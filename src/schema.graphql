# // Here we define our GQL schema...
# // We define a simple type of query with a field of info, that is
# // a required string

# // The schema is the heart of a gql server, required before you
# // can build out the server

# // Query is a `root type` along with `mutation` and `subscription`
# // Think of these root types as entry points; you can only send a gql DB/server
# // One of these three types

# // Schemas have a *definition* and an *implementation*
